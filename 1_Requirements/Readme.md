# Requirements
## Introduction
 “E-voting” is a term that is described in different information and communication technologies (ICT) platforms: Internet systems, polling booth machines, and telephone voting system.Each platform has both negative and positive features. However, the Internet voting systems are most popular and successful today. 

Each voter can vote for candidates remotely through the Internet. Voters can easily open websites, software, or applications on their computers or smartphones to vote anytime, anywhere. However, their voting system can be attacked if it does not have any algorithm or protocol to protect it. 

## Research
This project report includes four sections, introduction, background, system design, and testing and result. The background introduces E-voting system features, challenges, as well as requirements. It also explains cryptography related to Paillier 3 encryption and SSL protocol to communicate between a client and a server. Next, the section on system design is a main part of the report, which includes our design about a secure voting system. The next section is about testing and showing how the system design secures the voting system. The last section presents the future work of the project.
